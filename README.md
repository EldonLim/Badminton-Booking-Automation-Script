Python Automation Script for Badminton Court Booking  
Tired of the midnight rush to book a badminton court at my school, I decided to let Python handle the hassle! I created a fun automation script that executes precisely at 12am, ensuring I snag a court before anyone else. This nifty program not only saves me from staying up late but also guarantees I get to enjoy my favorite sport without the stress. It's a perfect blend of tech and convenience, making life a little more fun and a lot more automated!
